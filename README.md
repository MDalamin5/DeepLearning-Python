## Prerequisites

Before using this repository, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Other libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MDalamin5/DeepLearning-With-Tensorflow-and-Pytorch
cd repo-name
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Implemented Models

The repository contains implementations of the following neural networks:

1. **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)**
   - Implementations using both TensorFlow and PyTorch
2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
   - For image classification tasks
3. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**
   - Focused on sequential data processing
4. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**
   - Dealing with long-term dependencies in sequences
5. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)**
   - Generating synthetic data from noise
6. **Transfer Learning**
   - Using pre-trained models for new tasks
7. **Reinforcement Learning**
   - Neural networks for policy learning

## Usage

Each model comes with detailed Jupyter notebooks for training, evaluation, and experimentation. To run a specific model:

1. Navigate to the respective directory for TensorFlow or PyTorch.
2. Run the provided Python scripts or open the corresponding Jupyter notebook.

For example, to run the TensorFlow-based CNN implementation:
```bash
cd tensorflow/cnn
python train_cnn.py
```

For PyTorch-based RNN:
```bash
cd pytorch/rnn
python train_rnn.py
```
